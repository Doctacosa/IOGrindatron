# IOGrinder
Grindatron minigame in Minecraft, as featured on the [Creeper's Lab](https://www.creeperslab.net/).

Every four hours, a target is generated: for example, 1 x elytra, 2 x snowball, 8 x stone, etc. The players must then gather these materials and place them in an enderchest placed somewhere, ideally at the spawn point of the world. Successfully providing the set item gets them a point!

That means there are six potential targets to complete every day, keeping the players busy. A scoreboard is displayed to show how many targets each player has succesfully accomplished.

To force people to return to the spawn point, regular players aren't allowed to place enderchests.

[This news post](https://www.creeperslab.net/news/2020/05/519-challenge-the-grindatron-returns.html) includes the full details from a player's perspective.
